    <!-- Write out the bare-minimum HTML you'd need for this app to work -- don't touch any CSS yet! Put in enough <input> fields to account for the different kinds of user input you'll need. -->

<!-- Then define your model, and test that you can create a new instance given a symbol, and that it has the approprate functionality (price, totalValue, etc).

Then define your view, and test it's functionality in small pieces (i.e. make it render based on the associated model, then try having it update its model, etc).

Finally, add some style to make it look nicer!
